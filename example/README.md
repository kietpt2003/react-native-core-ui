This is a new [**Sample**]() project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

While it's possible to use npm, the tooling is built around yarn, so you'll have an easier time if you use yarn for development.

## Initialize project

Please do not use this command in sample project, instead of using at root package:

```sh
# Do not use this command in example folder!!!
yarn install
```
## Install new package!

```sh
# Provide '-W' for installing in example folder
cd example
yarn add some-package -W
```
